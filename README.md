# Algorithms Lab 2020

This repository contains my solutions for the course Algorithms Lab at ETH Zurich, held in Fall 2020. The course focuses on competitive programming, as it requires the students to solve programming exercises in C++ under time constraints. A wide spectrum of topic is covered, including sliding window, dynamic programming, greedy strategies, and the use of libraries such as CGAL and BGL, to tackle flow, linear programming, graph and geometric tasks. All my solutions give 100 points on the judge.
