# Algorithms Lab 2020

![Alt text](/wallpaper.jpg?raw=true "Title")


This repository contains my solutions for the [Algorithms Lab](https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS20/algolab/index.html) course at ETH Zurich (Fall 2020). The course focuses on competitive programming, as it requires the students to solve programming exercises in C++ under time constraints. Given the spirit of the course, some solutions might not follow coding's best practices. 

A wide spectrum of topic is covered, including sliding window, dynamic programming, greedy strategies, and the use of libraries such as CGAL and BGL, to tackle flow, linear programming, graph and geometric tasks. All my solutions give 100 points on the judge.
